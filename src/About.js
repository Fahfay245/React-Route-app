        Hi, I'm Mohammed Fayaz. This is my first web app created using react. My
        real goal is to achieve the full knowledge to completely work
        independently on new and existing technologies. I'm a self learner who
        has the potential to make myself a geek or a tech! Thank you for your
        visit. If there is any inconvenience please accept my apologies and
        visit homepage.
      </p>
    </main >
